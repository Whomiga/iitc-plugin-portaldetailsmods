This is a simple iitc plugin that shows the deployed Mods as pictures in the Portal Details
- The pictures are included in the script code, they are not retrieved from the net, so no extra
  bandwidth required
- The code has been moved from a much larger plugin (private for now) that has many more capabilities
  but problems and capabilities I'm not ready yet to make public. Figured someone might like this part
